### summary
usot is a system that allows people to post statements as truth and allows others vote to express disagreement. When there are enough disagree votes the statement will be considered non-unanamous. non-unanimity would enable evidense of truth to be provided by the statement's supporting group which could also be voted on. users will have a limited number of votes as to incentivize selective usage. when users decide they've been convinced of something they can take their votes back to use it elsewhere as to incentivize consensus.
