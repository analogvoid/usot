#Summary
A system that allows people to present statements as truth and allow others who may be skeptical to upvote enough to enable the skeptical group to ask "Why?". This would enable evidence/citations of truth to be provided by the supporting group which could further have "Why's" tossed at them. This would create a branching tree from the original statement of a bunch of "Why's" and explanatory statements. Users will have a time-limited limited number of upvotes as to incentivize selective usage. If you decide you've been convinced of something you can take your upvote back and use it elsewhere as to incentivize consensus.
